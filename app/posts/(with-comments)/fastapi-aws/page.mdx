# How to Deploy Fast API on AWS EC2

 Deploying your **FastAPI** application on **AWS EC2** is a powerful way to get your API online and accessible to the world. This guide walks you through the process in a simple and easy-to-follow way.
## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- A FastAPI project ready
- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of the terminal (Linux/Mac or WSL for Windows)
- Your FastAPI app code ready to upload

## Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

1. Log in to your AWS Console.
2. Navigate to **EC2** > **Instances** > **Launch Instance** .

3. Choose an **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** (or Ubuntu if you prefer).
4. Select a free-tier eligible instance (like t2.micro).

5. Configure security group:
    - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** and **Custom TCP (port 8000)** .
    - Also allow **SSH (port 22)** for access.

6. Download and save your **key pair (.pem file)** .
7. Launch the instance.

## Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance

Use your terminal to connect via SSH:

```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip
```


## üêç Step 3: Install Python & Dependencies

Update and install Python:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install python3-pip nginx

```

Configure nginx
```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/fastapi_nginx

vim
server {
		listen 80;
		server_name {your_Public IPv4 address};
		location / {
					proxy_pass://127.0.0.1:8000;
		} 

}


```


![Step 3: Install Python & Dependencies](/images/posts/fastapi-aws/awses2-7.gif)

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

## üìÅ Step 4: Upload Your FastAPI Code

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/diegofan-code/fastapi-tutorial.git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegofan-code/fastapi-tutorial.git
```

Enter the folder and install the dependencies from requirements.txt.

**Note:** Sometimes the machine may prevent you from installing packages using `pip3`. In that case, use the following command instead:

```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

```


Then run:
```bash
python3 -m uvicorn main:app

```

Now, FastAPI is running on your virtual cloud machine in AWS.  
To access the API, open your browser and go to `http://your-public-ip`.  
Since we haven‚Äôt configured SSL/TLS, make sure to use **HTTP** and not HTTPS.

**Finally, after testing, you can terminate your instance on AWS to avoid unnecessary charges.**

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

You've successfully deployed a **FastAPI application on AWS EC2** , set up **Nginx as a reverse proxy** , and exposed your API to the web ‚Äî all using free tools and services.
