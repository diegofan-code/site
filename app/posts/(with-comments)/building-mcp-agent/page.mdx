# 7 Rules for Beginners to Build MCP Agents

The future of AI isn’t just smarter models it’s **smarter integration**.

Enter the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context and tools to large language models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a **USB-C port for AI**: just as USB-C lets your laptop connect seamlessly to monitors, drives, and docks, MCP allows LLMs to securely plug into databases, APIs, files, and custom tools.

If you're building AI agents that go beyond chat agents that can act, retrieve, and automate — then **MCP is your foundation**.

In this guide, I’ll walk you through **7 practical rules** every beginner should follow when building their first MCP agent.

## What Is MCP?

According to [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/ ), MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol**, a lightweight, vendor-neutral communication standard that enables secure, structured interaction between LLM applications (**hosts**) and local or remote capabilities (**servers**).

Key components:
- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like Claude Desktop, IDE assistants, or AI notebooks that use LLMs and want access to tools.
- **MCP Clients**: Bridge software that connects hosts to one or more servers.
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs exposing specific functionalities (e.g., reading files, querying databases).
- **Data Sources**: Local or remote systems (files, APIs, services) accessed via MCP servers.

With MCP, your agent doesn’t need hardcoded integrations — it dynamically discovers and uses tools through a standardized interface.

Now, let’s dive into the **7 rules** to build effective MCP agents — even if you’re just starting out.

---

## 🔹 Rule 1: Start with a Clear Purpose

Before writing code, ask:  
> “What problem will my MCP agent solve?”

Examples:
- Retrieve internal documentation on demand
- Query a local database and summarize results
- Automate file organization in a project folder

Avoid building a “do-everything” agent. Instead, focus on **one valuable workflow**. This keeps development manageable and testing meaningful.

💡 Pro Tip: Use user stories:  
*“As a developer, I want to ask my AI assistant about recent commits, so I don’t have to check Git manually.”*

That’s a perfect scope for your first MCP server.

## 🔹 Rule 2: Understand the Client-Server Architecture

MCP follows a **client-server model**, where:
- The **host** (like Claude Desktop) sends requests
- The **MCP client** forwards them to the correct **MCP server**
- The **server** executes logic and returns results

You typically build the **MCP server** — the component that exposes functionality.

Don’t try to rebuild the host or client unless necessary. Leverage existing ones (like those in [Anthropic’s ecosystem](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/mcp )) and focus on creating value in your server.

## 🔹 Rule 3: Expose Capabilities Using Resources, Tools & Prompts

MCP defines three core ways your server shares context with the LLM:

### 📁 Resources
Static or dynamic content the LLM can read:
- File contents (`README.md`)
- API documentation
- Database schemas

Example: Your server lists all `.log` files in a directory as resources.

### ⚙️ Tools
Actions the LLM can invoke:
- `search_logs(query)`
- `create_ticket(description)`
- `get_weather(city)`

Each tool has parameters and expected output format.

### 💬 Prompts
Reusable prompt templates for common workflows:
- “Summarize the latest error logs”
- “Generate a weekly report from database entries”

Use these to guide the LLM toward consistent, useful outputs.

Start with **1–2 simple tools** and **a few resources**. Iterate from there.

## 🔹 Rule 4: Use Existing SDKs and Templates

You don’t need to implement the MCP transport layer from scratch.

Official SDKs (e.g., Python, typescript.js) handle:
- JSON-RPC over stdio
- Handshakes
- Request/response formatting

👉 Get started with:
- [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk )
- [MCP typescript.js SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

These give you scaffolding to focus on business logic, not plumbing.

Example: Creating a file reader server in Python becomes straightforward:

```python
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.types import ResourceResult

server = Server("file-reader")

@server.resource("files")
async def read_file(path: str):
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        return ResourceResult(content=f.read())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```

Boom 💣 — now your LLM can securely read any file you allow.

## 🔹Rule 5: Prioritize Security and Permissions
Just because your agent can access files doesn’t mean it should .

Always:

- Run MCP servers with minimal privileges
- Validate and sanitize all inputs (prevent path traversal!)
- Support opt-in permissions (e.g., user approves each new directory)
- Use TLS for remote connections
- Avoid hardcoding secrets

Remember: **your server extends the LLM’s reach** . With great power comes great responsibility.🕸️🕷️(e.g in memory of Uncle Ben)👴

## 🔹 Rule 6: Test Early with the MCP Inspector
Instrument your agent to log activity and expose metrics. This aids debugging and allows integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.

Debugging MCP integrations can be tricky without visibility.

Enter: MCP Inspector — a tool that lets you:

- Simulate host-server interactions
- View request/response payloads
- Validate schema compliance
- Test locally before connecting to real hosts. It saves hours.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```
*See every handshake, tool call, and error in real time.*

Also, enable logging in your server:

## 🔹 Rule 7: Build, Measure, Iterate
Your first MCP agent won’t be perfect — and that’s okay.

Launch with a narrow use case. Observe how users interact with it. Then improve.

Ask:

- Are they invoking the right tools?
- Do prompts need refinement?
- Are resources too broad or too limited?
Iterate based on feedback. Great agents evolve.

### Point of View

Building MCP agents isn't about mastering complex AI — it's about connecting intelligence to action .

By following these 7 rules:

- Define a clear purpose
- Respect the architecture
- Use resources, tools, and prompts wisely
- Leverage SDKs
- Secure by design
- Debug with tools
- Iterate relentlessly
…you’ll go from zero to a working, useful agent faster than you think.

The era of reactive chatbots is ending. The age of proactive, tool-enabled AI agents is beginning — and you now have the keys to build them .
